# Module-4-Pandas Challenge

The Jupyter notebook with the assignment is marked as 'main.ipynb'. The analysis report is included in this Jupyter Notebook. The summary tables created using Panads have been included in the analysis report in markdown for an easier read. It was noticed that Table 3 in the report sometimes does not show clearly in Jupyter Notebook but seems to show clearly in the VS Code environment. Hence, as a precaution, I have exported the 'main.ipynb' file as 'main.html' as a precaution. This clearly shows all the output and can be opened with any web browser.

The Python code with the Pandas module works well within the Jupyter Notebook, and the output for each section is shown in the 'main.ipynb' file. There are no errors in the code, but there are a few 'future warnings' displayed, which we understand from our class tutor can be ignored at present.
